CS6102 - Assignment 1: Turtle Fractal InterfaceThe python app EvaGoetzke.py is my application to generate fractal drawings with a tkinter interface. 
As technical contributions to the interface, I transformed the procedural code from the lab into a class and employed the ttk.tkinter module to style it further. I used one of the built-in themes and customised it so that all foreground and background colours matched based on a colour palette that I created. This also included the background colour of buttons when hovering over them and employing a different cursor to signify that the buttons are interactive. I have also included a colour slider and colour mode buttons so that a user of the interface can choose their own preferred colour theme based on the relations of colours from the colour palette. This was a little tricky, since I first needed to create a slider that makes it possible to select a specific hue. Since tkinter does not offer a gradient for its slider widget, I created the gradient myself and laid a slider over it, which gives the impression of choosing the colour directly. I also had difficulties translating the selected hue into four different hexadecimal numbers, but managed after researching for a while. I imported the ‘colorsys’ module to first translate the colours from an HSL space to an RGB colour space, and then used a calculation to translate the RGB values to the hexadecimal numbers. This now means that a user could choose any hue on the colour spectrum and either use a dark or light theme based on that hue. Overall, my goal was that the whole layout of the application was aesthetically pleasing, minimal while at the same time providing customisation options. Therefore, I also made sure that all widgets were of equal size, so that, for example, the option menu and draw button were of the same length as the entry widgets. This also included making sure that the padding was equal and that the text of the labels and other widgets were anchored to their frame similarly. To make sure that my fractal descriptions were readable, but did not take up too much space, I connected a scrollbar to my text widget in case of longer descriptions. Since I made sure that the padding was equal, I disabled the resizing option of the window so that the outer padding will stay uniform and symmetrical. I also implemented a function so that the application opens in the middle of a user’s screen to add to the symmetry. Although I did not manage to implement a progress bar without the fractal drawings freezing, I have put a status bar at the bottom of the page so that a user could see whether the program is done drawing. This might be important if the pen has gone off screen and it wouldn’t be easy to monitor anymore. For that reason, I also made sure that each fractal was placed in the centre of the canvas as best as possible, which was especially tricky for the Sierpinski Carpet, and have also added a recommended length to the description for each fractal. In addition, I added buttons that generate a random order and length within a range customised to different types of fractals that ensures that this is less likely to happen. I also contributed five different fractals to the selection of fractals from class. One of them is a circular fractal (“Crocheted Circles”), which draws 7 tangential circles of equal sizes into a big circle and continues to do so in the previously drawn circles. Inspired from the Apollonian gasket, I have also added three smaller tangential circles in-between each bigger circle on the circumference of the biggest circle, whose radius I calculated with the Descartes' Theorem. Otherwise, I focused on a diamond lozenge shape and experimented to create different figures, such as the “Star”, the “Pinwheel”, the “Diamond Eye” and the “Diamond Cube”. The latter one is like the Sierpinski Carpet or Koch’s Snowflake, in that it is not recursive, but takes another function, in this case a diamond which is split into equal smaller parts with each increase of the order, and makes a different shape, a cube, out of it. The Diamond Eye is a fractal which draws a diamond shape. With each recursion, the diamonds get smaller so that their full length is one side of the diamond, which I calculated with the Pythagorean Theorem. For some orders, this results in the appearance of an eye. The Star and Pinwheel are similar to each other, in that they both employ the diamond shape in a circular pattern, repeating it either four or six times in one order. Each recursion is smaller, to the same extent as they were for the Diamond Eye, and offset at an angle, which made it a challenge to bring the turtle back to its origin at the right angle, but creates beautiful shapes, either in the form of a star or in a form that reminds of a pinwheel.
